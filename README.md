# Analyzing a Public Dataset to Appreciate the Women in Our Lives

March 8th marks International Women's Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the achievements and contributions of women worldwide. To commemorate this day, we will be analyzing a public dataset about women to gain insights into their lives and experiences. We will be using Python to perform the analysis and visualize the data, making it easy for beginners to follow along.

## Dataset

This project analyzes the [Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fnicapotato%2Fwomens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) dataset available on Kaggle to gain insights into women's lives and experiences. The dataset contains customer reviews and ratings of clothing products from an e-commerce website, along with information about the clothing item, customer demographics, and their reviews and ratings of the product.

## Getting Started
To run this analysis, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`

Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can clone this repository and run the analysis script:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/womens-clothing-ecommerce-reviews.git
cd womens-clothing-ecommerce-reviews
python analysis.py
```

## Analysis

The analysis script uses pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to analyze and visualize the data. It first reads in the dataset using pandas and then generates two visualizations:
- A count plot showing the distribution of ratings
- A box plot showing the relationship between age and ratings

Based on the dataset, the analysis draws several conclusions and makes recommendations for the e-commerce industry. For example, since the majority of reviews have a rating of 4 or 5, it is essential to focus on providing high-quality products and excellent customer service. Additionally, since there is a slight relationship between age and ratings, it may be helpful to tailor marketing strategies to specific age groups to increase customer satisfaction.
